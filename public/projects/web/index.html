                <p>
                  I decided I might as well just learn how to make my portfolio
                  website by myself, from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I already had a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, but going
                  through multiple iterations of my personal website over the
                  past year or two has been the most enlightening experience. I
                  honestly wouldn't trade any of the bugs, sleepless nights, and
                  next-day epiphanies for any drag-and-drop web design tool. (I
                  had the luxury of being my own client and setting my own
                  deadline, though. I'll own up to that!)
                </p>
                <p>Throughout my journey so far I've gotten the hang of:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Eleventy, a static site generator</li>
                  <li>
                    Basic Webpack tooling to help the JavaScript lighten up (it
                    wasn't much but it was so gratifying)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Pug, an HTML pre-processor I absolutely love (that makes
                    HTML so much more accessible for my eyes!)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    SCSS mixins, partials, variables up the wazoo to help with
                    palette flexibility site-wide
                  </li>
                  <li>Netlify to deploy my website from GitHub</li>
                  <li>
                    Netlify CMS, a headless CMS which I then learned to connect
                    with Eleventy
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Strapi as my most-recent and favored CMS thanks to its
                    easy-on-the-eyes UI
                  </li>
                  <li>Axios, GSAP, and other node packages</li>
                  <li>
                    Figma components, properties, variants, and the like to
                    really help visualize my indecisiveness
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Mobile-first, responsive development and design that doesn't
                    overly rely on media queries
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    and having the courage to admit sometimes a stray comma WILL
                    get the better of me for an unacceptable amount of time and
                    that we can just look at it again tomorrow
                  </li>
